<p>My first paragraph.

This is going to be an epic and I anm going to figure

out how to build and manage my own website

I just need to figure out </p>

<p>
Step 1: Get a handle on HTML and CSS

These two languages form the backbone of the web development process.

Step 2: Master the basics of JavaScript
        Step 3: Master the document object model

        Install Pelican and Markdown.
