Hello World

This is going to be an epic and I anm going to figure

out how to build and manage my own website

I just need to figure out

Step 1: Get a handle on HTML and CSS

        These two languages form the backbone of the web development process.


Step 2: Master the basics of JavaScript


Step 3: Master the document object model

Install Pelican and Markdown.
